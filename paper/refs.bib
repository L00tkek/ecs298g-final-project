    abstractNote={Story sifters attempt to automatically or semi-automatically extract
                  nuggets of compelling narrative content from vast chronicles of game or
                  simulation events. Though sifting has successfully been used to enable
                  novel computational narrative play experiences, its utility is limited
                  by the fundamentally retrospective nature of existing sifters, which can
                  only recognize storyful event sequences once they have fully played out.
                  To address this limitation, we introduce Winnow: a domain-specific
                  language for specifying story sifting patterns that can be executed
                  incrementally to detect potentially storyful event sequences while they
                  are still playing out. We evaluate Winnow by applying it to several
                  specific use cases and show that it is well-suited to the implementation
                  of prospective as well as retrospective narrative intelligence.},

    DOI={10.1609/aiide.v18i1.21955}, 
    abstractNote={We present Loose Ends, a mixed-initiative co-creative storytelling play
                  experience in which a human player and an AI system work together to
                  compose a story. Loose Ends specifically aims to provide computational
                  support for managing multiple parallel plot threads and bringing these
                  threads to satisfying conclusions—something that has proven difficult in
                  past attempts to facilitate playful mixed-initiative storytelling. We
                  describe the overall human-AI interaction loop in Loose Ends, including
                  the implementation of the rules-based AI system that enables this
                  interaction loop; discuss four examples of desirable mixed-initiative
                  interactions that are possible in Loose Ends, but not in similar
                  systems; and present results from a preliminary expert evaluation of
                  Loose Ends. Altogether, we find that Loose Ends shows promise for
                  creating a sense of coauthorship in the player while also mitigating the
                  directionlessness reported by players of earlier systems.},

abstract="Dreams of the prospect of computational narrative suggest a future of deeply
interactive and personalized fictional experiences that engage our empathy. But the gulf
between our current moment and that future is vast. How do we begin to bridge that divide
now, both for learning more specifics of these potentials and to create experiences today
that can have some of their impact on audiences? We present Bad News, a combination of
theatrical performance practices, computational support, and Wizard-of-Oz interaction
techniques. These allow for rich, real-time interaction with a procedurally generated
world. We believe our approach could enable other research groups to explore similar
territory---and the resulting experience is engaging and affecting in ways that help
strengthen the case for our envisioned futures and also makes the case for trying to field
such experiences today (e.g., in experimental theater or location-based entertainment
contexts). Bad News is a realized game enjoyed by players with varying degrees of
performance experience, and won the Innovative Game Design track of the 2016 ACM
Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI) Student Game Competition.",

abstract="Story sifting, also known as story recognition, has been identified as one of
the major design challenges currently facing interactive emergent narrative. However,
despite continued interest in emergent narrative approaches, there has been relatively
little work in the area of story sifting to date, leaving it unclear how a story sifting
system might best be implemented and what challenges are likely to be encountered in the
course of implementing such a system. In this paper, we present Felt, a simple query
language-based story sifter and rules-based simulation engine that aims to serve as a
first step toward answering these questions. We describe Felt's architecture, discuss
several design case studies of interactive emergent narrative experiences that make use of
Felt, reflect on what we have learned from working with Felt so far, and suggest
directions for future work in the story sifting domain.",
