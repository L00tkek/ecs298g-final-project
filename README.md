# Shepherd

Shepherd is an incremental story sifting-based drama manager that guides simulations towards producing interesting narratives. Shepherd represents a completely new application of story sifting which is ripe for further exploration and evaluation. The system is very easy to author for, is extremely scalable and extensible, and results in the emergence of surprising and interesting character behavior from otherwise unstructured simulation, while still leaving room for players to narrativize. We hope that, in the future, this new paradigm can aid in the creation of interactive digital narratives that offer the usual pleasures of emergent narrative while minimizing some of the associated pains.
